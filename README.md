# NBA_Shot_Selection_Analysis Overview
This document provides a technical overview of the NBA Shot Selection Analysis system. This system analyzes shot data from the 2016 Chicago Bulls to predict shot outcomes based on various factors including shot location, player position, and game context. The system combines data processing, machine learning, and web visualization to create an interactive shot prediction tool.

## System Purpose and Components
The NBA Shot Selection Analysis system serves to:

1. Process and analyze basketball shot data from the Chicago Bulls 2016 season
2. Train machine learning models to predict shot outcomes
3. Visualize shot patterns and player performance
4. Provide an interactive web interface for shot prediction

## System Architecture
The system follows a data pipeline architecture where raw shot data is processed, analyzed, and used to train a machine learning model. The trained model is then deployed in a web application for interactive use.

### Data Flow

## Key Components
The system consists of the following key components:

1. Data Processing Notebooks:

- Chicago2016shots.ipynb: Cleans and processes raw shot data
- Machine_Learning_Shots.ipynb: Prepares data for machine learning
- ML_POS_SHOT_NICK.ipynb: Performs feature engineering for the model

2. Machine Learning Model:

- Gradient Boosting Classifier that predicts shot outcomes
- Trained on Chicago Bulls 2016 shot data
- Model saved as model.pkl for use in the web application

3. Visualization Components:

- halfcourt.ipynb: Generates shot charts and visualizations
- Shot charts for individual players and positions

4. Web Application:

- Flask backend (app.py) that serves API endpoints
- HTML/JavaScript frontend for user interaction
- Interactive basketball court visualization

## Machine Learning Model
The shot prediction model is built using a Gradient Boosting Classifier that analyzes various factors to predict shot outcomes.


## Web Application Structure
The web application provides an interactive interface for users to predict shot outcomes based on selected parameters.

## System Workflow
The end-to-end workflow of the system follows these steps:

1. Data Acquisition and Processing:

- Raw shot data from the 2016 Chicago Bulls season is loaded from shot log CHI.csv
- Data is cleaned, filtered, and processed through Jupyter notebooks

2. Machine Learning:

- Features are engineered from the processed data
- A Gradient Boosting Classifier is trained to predict shot outcomes
- The trained model is serialized and saved as model.pkl

3. Web Application:

- The Flask backend loads the trained model
- API endpoints expose model functionality
- The frontend provides an interactive interface for shot prediction
- Users can select parameters and view predicted shot outcomes

4. Visualization:

- Shot charts visualize player performance and shooting patterns
- Interactive court visualization shows shot locations and outcomes

This architecture enables analysts and basketball enthusiasts to explore shooting patterns and predict shot outcomes based on historical data from the 2016 Chicago Bulls season.
